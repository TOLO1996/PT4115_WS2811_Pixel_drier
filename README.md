# PT4115_WS2811_Pixel_drier
3W RGB LED driver using PT4115 and WS2811 driver

# Project description
Create a control system for power RGB LEDs controlled by WS2811. The device must be compact. Ultimately, 60 systems will be used in the chain.
## Assumptions:
1. 3W RGB LED control
2. Control of the PT4115 or similar system
3. Highest possible supply voltage to limit the current. 
4. Small dimensions possible
5. Using ready-made lenses for LEDs
